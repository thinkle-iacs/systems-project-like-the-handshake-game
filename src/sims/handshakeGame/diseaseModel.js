* What we are simulating:
* Simulates a simple infection model in which people "pair off" in each round and then have a 
* percentage chance of infecting each other.
* 
* What our model does:
* To simulate pairing off:
* - We start by shuffling the population into a new order.
* - We then move through the population by two's (each two is a partner).
* - We move their x/y coordinates so we can visually "see" them pairing in the simulation with 
*   one partner moving to the other.
* - If one partner is infected and not the other, we have a chance of infecting the other.
* 
* Note: We also keep track of people who are newly infected in each round so we can graph new infections
* separately from total infections.
