/* Update this code to simulate a simple disease model! */

/* For this simulation, you should model a *real world disease* based on some real information about it.
*
* Options are:
* - Mononucleosis, which has an extremely long incubation period.
*
* - The flu: an ideal model for modeling vaccination. The flu evolves each season, so you can model
    a new "season" of the flu by modeling what percentage of the population gets vaccinated and how
    effective the vaccine is.
* 
* - An emerging pandemic: you can model a new disease (like COVID-19) which has a high infection rate.
*    Try to model the effects of an intervention like social distancing on the spread of the disease.
*    You can model the effects of subclinical infections (people who are infected but don't show symptoms)
*    by having a percentage of the population be asymptomatic carriers on the spread of the disease.
*
* - Malaria: a disease spread by a vector (mosquitoes). You can model the effects of the mosquito population
    (perhaps having it vary seasonally) on the spread of the disease, or attempt to model the effects of
    interventions like bed nets or insecticides.
*
* For whatever illness you choose, you should include at least one citation showing what you are simulating
* is based on real world data about a disease or a real-world intervention.

to add a property such as daysInfected which tracks how long they've been infected.

Similarily, if you wanted to track immunity, you would need a property that shows
