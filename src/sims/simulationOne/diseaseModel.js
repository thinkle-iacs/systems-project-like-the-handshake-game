/* Update this code to simulate a simple disease model! */

/* For this simulation, let's consider a simple disease that spreads through contact.
You can implement a simple model which does one of the following:

1. Model the different effects of different numbers of contacts: in my Handshake Model, two people are in 
   contact each round. What happens if you put three people in contact? Four? Five? Consider different options
   such as always putting people in contact with the people "next" to them (i.e. the people before or after them
   in line) or randomly selecting people to be in contact (just do one of these for your model).

2. Take the "handshake" simulation code as your model, but make it so you can recover from the disease. How does the
spread of the disease change when you set people to recover after a set number of days.

3. Add a "quarantine" percentage to the handshake model: if a person is infected, they have a chance of being quarantined
and not interacting with others in each round.
